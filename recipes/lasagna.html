    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a baked casserole made with wide flat pasta and layered with fillings such as ragú, bechamel, vegetables and various cheeses. The dish is traditionally made in Italy with Parmigiano-Reggiano (Parmesan cheese), Béchamel sauce (white sauce), and ragù (a meat-based sauce). </p>

        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and parsley. Simmer covered for about an hour and a half.</li>
        <li>Cook lasagna noodles according to package directions. Drain noodles and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg and remaining parsley.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble lasagna: Spread one cup of meat sauce in the bottom of a baking dish. Arrange noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon one cup of meat sauce over mozzarella cheese slices and sprinkle with one fourth of grated Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil: to prevent sticking either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for about 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake for another 25 minutes or until hot and bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
