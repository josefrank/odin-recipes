    <p>Baked ziti is a classic Italian-American pasta dish that's typically made with ziti pasta, tomato sauce, and cheese, all baked together in the oven until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ziti pasta</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 jar (24 ounces) of your favorite pasta sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375Â°F.</li>
        <li>Cook the ziti pasta according to package instructions until it's al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the ground beef and garlic, and cook until the beef is browned and fully cooked. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Add the pasta sauce to the skillet and bring to a simmer.</li>

        <li>Add the cooked ziti pasta to the skillet with the meat sauce and stir until the pasta is coated.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the pasta mixture in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Top with dollops of the cheese mixture.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining pasta mixture on top of the cheese. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese and 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 25 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
